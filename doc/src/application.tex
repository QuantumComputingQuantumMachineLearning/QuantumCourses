\section{Motivation and Strategic Importance of Quantum Education}

Quantum technologies promise to transform a wide range of industries by delivering capabilities far beyond what is possible with classical systems. From revolutionizing drug discovery and materials science to enabling ultra-secure communications and advanced sensors, quantum computing and quantum information science are poised to become pillars of 21st-century innovation. Recognizing this potential, governments and industries worldwide have made quantum technology a strategic priority. For example, the United States has elevated Quantum Information Science and Technology (QIST) to one of its highest national R&D priorities, yet currently lacks sufficient qualified talent to maintain competitiveness—indeed, the shortage of quantum-trained professionals is now viewed as a national security risk. Similarly, Europe’s \textit{Quantum Flagship} initiative highlights that a trained workforce is a crucial lynchpin for powering the emerging quantum industry and ensuring the success of the “second quantum revolution”.

Beyond the strategic and scientific imperatives, the economic stakes of quantum technology are enormous. Recent analyses project that quantum computing alone could create hundreds of billions of dollars in global value in the coming decades (with forecasts of up to $850~billion in economic impact by 2040) . Nations and companies that lead in quantum innovation stand to gain significantly in economic competitiveness and technological advantage.

However, realizing this promise will require a robust talent pipeline. At present, the field faces a critical skills gap: studies find that there is only about one qualified quantum expert available for every three job openings in the sector. Without substantial investment in education and training, it is projected that by 2025 fewer than half of quantum computing job vacancies could be filled under current trends. In response to these challenges, policymakers and scientific leaders are calling for new and sustained educational initiatives at all levels. Developing a new generation of quantum scientists and engineers is viewed as essential to accelerate research, drive innovation, and maintain leadership in this strategic field.

\section{Proposed Graduate-Level Courses}

To address the identified workforce needs, we propose a graduate curriculum comprising five specialized courses covering the breadth of quantum technologies.
